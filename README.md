# SCAMPy_tests #

SCAMPy is a Single Column Atmospheric Model in Python.
The code is available at [SCAMPy](https://github.com/cmkaul/SCAMPy).

This is a (work in progress) suite of tests for SCAMPy.
Tests are done using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/).
The workflow assumes that SCAMPY and SCAMPY_tests are available in the same folder
and that the SCAMPy code has been compiled.
